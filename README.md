# Protected routes

## Integrating with React App

React url: https://github.com/sleeQwQ/wad2-moviesApp

Not fetch data directly from TMDB, but get it by requesting from this api.

# Integration example

~~~Javascript
  export const getUpcomingMovies = () => {
    return fetch(
      '/api/upcoming',{headers:{
        'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token') 
      },
      method:'get',
      }
    )
      .then(res => res.json());
  };

~~~

Don't forget to add "proxy": YOURHOST in package.json

## Extra features

 + Swagger graphic API design. You can try the requests in a graphic interface.
